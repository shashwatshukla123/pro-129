encoding='utf8' :--
UTF-8 is one of the most commonly used encodings, and Python often defaults to using it. 
UTF stands for “Unicode Transformation Format”, and the '8' means that 8-bit values are used in the encoding. 
(There are also UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodings, but they are less frequently used than UTF-8.)

UTF-8 is the most widely used way to represent Unicode text in web pages, 
and you should always use UTF-8 when creating your web pages and databases. 
But, in principle, UTF-8 is only one of the possible ways of encoding Unicode characters.
